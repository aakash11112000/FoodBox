A restaurant inventory management system

This project is my first amateurish attempt at creating an inventory management system.

This project is created using Python. It uses several Python modules most of which already come with the standard library.
One important module - openpyxl - is not included in the standard library and has to be installed manually. The suggested way to do that would be using the command "pip install openpyxl".

There is a documentation file attached along with this project. Please refer to it for any inquires.
